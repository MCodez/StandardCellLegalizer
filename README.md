# **Standard Cell Legalizer**  

## **Overview**  
Standard cell legalization is a critical step in **VLSI physical design**, ensuring that cells are placed without overlaps while adhering to design rules. This algorithm efficiently resolves **cell overlaps** and aligns them to a grid while keeping movement minimal.  

## **Features**  
- ‚úî **Grid-based snapping** ‚Äì Aligns cells to predefined grid points for structured placement.  
- ‚úî **Overlap detection and resolution** ‚Äì Handles **cell-to-cell** and **boundary overlaps** efficiently.  
- ‚úî **Minimal displacement strategy** ‚Äì Moves cells in the **least movement direction** to minimize disruptions.  
- ‚úî **Deadlock handling** ‚Äì Avoids infinite loops due to conflicting moves.  
- ‚úî **Visual comparison** ‚Äì Generates **before-and-after plots** of cell placement.  
- ‚úî **Summary report** ‚Äì Provides details on movement per cell and the **maximum movement required**.  

## **Applications**  
üìå **VLSI Physical Design** ‚Äì Ensures proper **standard cell legalization** in chip layout.  
üìå **EDA Tool Development** ‚Äì Can be integrated into **place-and-route (PnR) tools**.  
üìå **Computational Geometry** ‚Äì Useful for **polygon placement** and **overlap resolution** in general applications.  

## **Algorithm Workflow**  
1. **Snap cells to grid** based on the predefined **grid height**.  
2. **Filter out cells** that are **outside the block boundary** (ignored in further processing).  
3. **Detect overlaps** with **other cells** and the **block boundary**.  
4. **Compute displacement vectors** for each overlapping cell in all four directions (**left, right, up, down**).  
5. **Move the cell in the direction requiring the least displacement** while maintaining alignment to the grid.  
6. **Update cell positions** dynamically to avoid **conflicting movements**.  
7. **Handle deadlocks** by restoring the original position if movement oscillates.  
8. **Visualize results** by plotting **initial and final cell locations**.  
9. **Summarize movements**, identifying:  
   - Movement per cell  
   - **Maximum movement required**  
   - **Which cell moved the most**
